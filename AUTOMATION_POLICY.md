## Automation and Approval Policy

**Effective Date:** September 18, 2025

### 1. Routine and Maintenance Actions
- Routine, incremental, or previously approved automation/code changes may proceed automatically.
- No user intervention or approval is required for these actions.

### 2. New Features, Major Changes, or Sensitive Actions
- Any new automation feature, major workflow/code change, or potentially destructive/sensitive action must be explicitly approved by the user before proceeding.
- The agent must always prompt the user for consent and wait for clear agreement before executing such actions.

### 3. User Direction
- The user may direct the agent to proceed with new features or major changes at any time.
- Once agreement is reached, the agent may proceed with the approved action(s) without further prompts for that specific task.

### 4. Policy Scope
- This policy applies to all scripts, notebooks, automation, and code in this repository.
- The agent must respect this policy at all times unless the user explicitly updates or overrides it.

---

**Summary:**
- Hands-off for routine/approved work.
- Always ask for approval for new, major, or sensitive actions.
- Proceed only after user and agent are in agreement for such actions.
